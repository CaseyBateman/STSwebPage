                    <p><h2>Pediatric Therapy Solutions</h2>
                    Pediatric Therapy Solutions is a  unique occupational therapy company focused on treating children with a wide range of developmental challenges, including the following:  Autism, ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, and Developmental Delays. We also treat children who are having difficulties at school, including: Poor handwriting, Dysgraphia, difficulty copying from the board, skipping lines when reading, inability to sit still or focus in class, as well as difficulties with social skills.<br><br>
                    
We offer occupational therapy services, which help children to achieve independence and success with their everyday activities, or 'jobs' in life. For children, their 'job' is to play, learn and develop while keeping themselves calm and attentive to their work. An occupational therapist assesses a child's skills in the areas of motor coordination, attention, social participation, play skills and academic development.  We then compare this to what is developmentally appropriate and determine if services would benefit the child. If so, the therapist will design a treatment plan that includes fun and therapeutic activities to help children learn new skills for improved success at home, school and throughout life.<br><br>

At PTS, we understand that each child we treat has unique challenges that require individualized programs to maximize their potential for success in life.  We believe that effective early intervention is the KEY to unlocking a child's full potential.  This includes in-clinic treatments as well as parent education.  We educate parents to empower them with the tools that they need to help their children at home and throughout life.

                    </ul></h4>
Hi! I am Danielle Mixon and I'm thrilled to be able to offer outpatient pediatric therapy to the children of Ascension parish and the surrounding areas! I am an occupational therapist with 15 years of experience working with children and adult populations in a variety of settings. I have experience working in pediatric outpatient clinics, as well as in the public school system. Through my work, I've noticed that although our community has many children with developmental challenges, until now, there have been no outpatient therapy services available in Ascension parish. Parents were having to drive to Baton Rouge or further for outpatient therapy, and too many children just weren't able to get the early intervention that they needed.<br><br>

In addition to being an occupationat therapist, I am also a parent of a child with developmental challenges. Having a child with challenges, and living the daily life and facing the same obstacles that my parents and their families face has changed the way that I practice therapy. I realize now more than ever that every child is truly unique and has unique difficulties that must be addressed in a way that works for that child. Through research, cosulting with other pediatric professionals, and an extensive amount of training, I have learned about many different techniques and strategies that have proven to be effective with treating children with various challenges. One method in particular, the Masgutova Method (MNRI- Masgutova Neuro Sensory Motor Reflex Integration), has been life changing for my son. The use of these techniques often results in global improvements in children, and it was the key to my son's ability to overcome his physical, mental and emotional challenges. There were many other important factors, but when we started MNRI, his life started to change. He has made astounding progress, and is currently a happy, smart child who is doing well in school and has many friends. This would certainly not have been the case without effective early intervention.<br><br>

It was through my peronal experience with having a child with challenges, as well as seeing a growing need in our community that lead me to decide to open Pediatric Therapy Solutions.<br><br>

At Pediatric Therapy Solutions (PTS), I work with children with mild to severe challenges, including everything from problems in school such as poor handwriting, difficulty copying from the board, focus and attention difficulties, unusual behaviors, to Autism Spectrum Disorders, Sensory Processing Disorder, ADHD, Cerebral Palsy, Developmental Delays, Dysgraphia, and Fine Motor concerns.<br><br>

                    After a thorough initial evaluation, an individualized therapy program is designed for each child. I am one of the only therapists in this area to have extensive training in the Masgutova Method, which has proven to result in global overall improvements in function. For more information on this intervention, visit the website at <a href="http://masgutovamethod.com/">www.Masgutovamethod.com.</a><br><br>

I treat every child like I would my own, and offer one-on-one treatment sessions that inclde educating parents on interventions that they can do at home to maxamize their child's potential. I believe wholeheartedly, and I speak from experience, that EFFECTIVE early intervention is the KEY to unlocking each child's full potential in life.<br><br>

If you feel that your child has potential that has not been unlocked, I encourage you to contact me to schedule  free consultation. Your child may have an abundance of potential just waiting to show it's shining face.</p>

<h3>MNRI</h3>
<h3>Masgutova Neuro-Sensory Reflex Integration</h3>
The Masgutova Method is my area of specialty, and is what sets my services apart from other therapy clinics in Baton Rouge and the surrounding areas. I am one of the only outpatient occupational therapists with extensive training in this highly specialized type of therapy in our area. The Masgutova Method is a scientifically proven treatment approach that, in short, focuses on the correction of dysfunctional reflex patterns. It's work that's done primarily on the body, and with these specialized treatments, children are experiencing global improvements in function. Not only are they experiencing fine and gross motor improvements, but also improved language skills, focus and attention, behavior, as well as decreased anxiety. It's a hands on set of techniques that can be taught to parents so they can further help their children at home. Children with almost any type of challenge can benefit from the Masgutova Method, from infants and toddlers who aren't meeting their developmental milestones on time, to kids who are struggling in school, to children with mild to severe Autism. These techniques can truly be lifechanging for a child with challenges. For addititional information, visit the website at <a href="http://masgutovamethod.com/">www.MasgutovaMethod.com</a>.

<h3>Vision Therapy for improved Visual Processing</h3>
Vision therapy helps a child to use his/her eyes functionally. Often these children have 20/20 eyesight. The way that children use their eyes affects many aspects of life, including behavior, the ability to sit still, handwriting, motor coordination, and academic performance. Improvements in these areas are often seen with the implementation of vision therapy.
